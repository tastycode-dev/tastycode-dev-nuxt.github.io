title: "Tasty C++: Memory Layout of std::string"
---

For a professional C++ developer, it's crucial to understand memory organization of the data
structures and complexity of their operations. This is especially important for classes from the C++
Standard Library. In this post of Tasty C++ series we'll look under the hood of `std::string`, so
that you can effectively work with C++ strings, design better data structures, and write faster
code.

In C++, `std::string` is a sequence of characters that are stored in the buffer that spans a
_contiguous_ area of memory. This means that individual characters can be efficiently accessed by
index at O(1) time. The _size_ and _location_ of this buffer can change, when the string is
modified, and are managed internally by `std::string` itself.

Various implementations if the C++ Standard Library

## Long Strings

To fully represent its internal state, `std::string` needs three pieces of information:

- **Size** -- the current number of characters in the string.
- **Data** -- the pointer to the memory buffer where characters are stored.
- **Capacity** -- the max number of character the buffer can fit.

(We can use size and data buffer only, imposing that buffer fits exactly size bytes. Every time the
string grows or shrinks we are required to reallocate the buffer to preserve this condition. Memory
reallocation is a costly operation, hence it's more efficient to overgrow the buffer. Hence, the
capacity tells us how much space is left.)

In C++, we can implement a string as:

```
class MyString {
    char *    m_data;
    size_t    m_size;
    size_t    m_capacity;
}
```

In total this is 24 bytes, which is only 3x more than a fundamental `void *`, `size_t`, or `double`.

Let's see what is the size of `std::string` in the most popular implementations of the C++ standard
library:

| MSVC     | GCC libstdc++ | LLVM libc++ |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 32 bytes | 32 bytes      | 24 bytes    |

To our surprise, only **LLVM** allocates predicted **24 bytes** for `std::string`. In contrast, for
the same string both **MSVC** and **GCC** allocate **32 bytes**. All these numbers are correct and
every experienced C++ programmer should know them.

## Short Strings

Let's get some intuition about why various implementation allocate different amount of memory for
the same object. In fact, 24 or 32 bytes is already enough to fit a relatively big string, with no
need to allocate dynamic memory (and then free it, which is also costly). The trick, called **Small
String Optimization** (aka SSO), is to store string characters in the memory dedicated for the size,
capacity, and data pointer fields. Not sure this technique is part of the C++ Standard, but for sure
it's popular among various implementations.

Without going into much technicalities of SSO, let's mention two points worth to remember.

1. **How big is "small" in SSO ?** It seems obvious that every implementation is free to extend
   internal buffer for a small string far beyond required 24 bytes. This is why `std::string` in
   MSVC and GCC is 32 bytes. However, the capacity of these objects is:
   <p><p>

   | MSVC     | GCC libstdc++ | LLVM libc++ |
   | -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
   | 15 chars | 15 chars      | 22 chars    |

   Again, LLVM version seems to beat MSVC and GCC, since for a smaller memory usage (24 bytes) it's
   able to store longer strings (22 chars). (In fact, it's possible to fully utilize the memory and
   fit 23 chars + `'\0'`.)

2. **How slow is "optimization" in SSO ?** In this particular case, utilizing more space is not for
   free. The more characters we pack into a string's memory area, the more CPU operations we have to
   run. For LLVM, with its superior memory efficiency, even such a simple call as `size()` requires
   to check if the string is short or long. This sort of conditions might slow down a calculation
   pipeline.

   For example, compare final code for `std::string::size()` in GCC and LLVM:
   <p><p>

   | GCC libstdc++                         | LLVM libc++                            |
   | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
   | <img src="/img/string-size-gcc.png"/> | <img src="/img/string-size-llvm.png"/> |

Eventually, it's hard to say which approach is more efficient. Now, that you know the difference,
the best advice here is to experiment with various implementations and benchmark your particular use
case.

## Memory Growth

Finally, let's see on how `std::string` grows it's internal buffer when it's time to allocate more
memory. Some
[comments in the GCC sources](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/basic_string.tcc#L142),
mentioned _amortized linear time requirement_ and _exponential growth policy_. Not clear if this is
internal GCC decision or part of the C++ Standard. In any case, all three implementations use
exponential growth, so that **MSVC** has **1.5x factor** growth, while **GCC** and **LLVM** use **2x
factor**. Below are some examples with more explicit (but simplified) code:

**MSVC**

```
size_t newCapacity(size_t newSize, size_t oldCap) {
    return std::max(newSize | 0x0f, oldCap + oldCap / 2);
}
```

Example: 15, 31, 47, 70, 105, 157, 235, 352, 528, 792, 1'188, 1'782, 2'673, 4'009.

**GCC libstdc++**

```
size_t newCapacity(size_t newSize, size_t oldCap) {
    return std::max(newSize + 1, 2 * oldCap);
}
```

Example: 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 960, 1'920, 3'840, 7'680, 15'360, 30'720.

**LLVM libc++**

```
size_t newCapacity(size_t newSize, size_t oldCap) {
    return std::max(newSize, 2 * oldCap) + 1;
}
```

Example: 22, 47, 95, 191, 383, 767, 1'535, 3'071, 6'143, 12'287, 24'575, 49'151.

## Summary

As we saw, there are a couple of tradeoffs when working with strings in C++:

- Allocate on the **heap** (long strings) vs Reuse the **stack** (short strings)

- Reserve **24 bytes** (LLVM) vs **32 bytes** (GCC, MSVC)

- **15 chars** + Simple Logic (GCC, MSVC) vs **22 chars** + Complex Logic (LLVM)

In some cases they might be the nice features provided directly by the C++ Standard Library. In
other situations they might be the limitations, which require extra attention from your side or even
completely new implementation.

Hopefully, these details will make you a better programmer, help write more efficient C++ code, and
design better data structures.
