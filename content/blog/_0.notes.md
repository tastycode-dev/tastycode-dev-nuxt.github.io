# Random Notes and Ideas

- Media Hub: blog post + YouTube video. Draw / animate memory, data structure operations. Memory as
  table, cache-line wide (64 bytes).

- How costly is risk managing options in various models (PnL explain accuracy) ?

- Cloud computing in finance is worth it (for batch jobs) ? Origin: start small and scale as needed.
  Memory management = slow serialization. What is core business and competence (hint, not software
  development or hardware ops).

## Tasty C++

- Inside of `std::string` / `std::map` / `std::shared_ptr` / `std::set` / `std::vector`.
  Explain internals with step-by-step examples of various operations (and differences among most
  common implementations, if any).

## Tasty Quant

- Local Volatility with FD PDE. Solve Dupire equation. Calibrate to American option prices. Switch
  to moneyness.

- Interview Quants. Start with CS collegues.
